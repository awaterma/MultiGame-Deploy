title=Participant's Guide
purpose.title=1. Purpose and overview of the game
purpose.1=Learn how to interact with other participants in a watershed with global (game-wide) consequences. Interact \
with other participants to negotiate game play in socially and environmentally threatened situations.
purpose.2=Four participants (role-playing local peasant proprietors) take turns to develop forested sites in a wooded \
watershed. The latter is divided into 4 territories (quadrants with sixteen sites each) separated by 4 creeks. Each \
participant colonizes one territory with three land uses that have different values (points). Eight of the sixteen \
sites on your territory are exclusive for your use, but the other eight are on the borders of the other \
participant«s properties. These 8 boundary sites will be owned by the neighbor who first colonizes them. In a \
round, individual land use decisions are made by each participant; the aggregate decisions of participants can push \
deforestation beyond local and game-wide thresholds, with negative consequences that affect some or all participants \
and can even collapse the game before anyone wins it. Participants have a limited opportunity during one round to \
revert these threats, at a cost for the participant who decides to do so. Whoever reaches 24 points first in these \
challenging conditions acquires higher local status and wins the game.
token.title=2. Token values and winning conditions
token.1=2.1. Each participant colonizes his quadrant with three types of land use tokens, one site and token per turn.
token.2=2.2. Available land uses, represented by tokens, have the following values:
token.table=Token   Land Use    Points\
F 	Forest Management 	1\
M 	Moderate Cattle Grazing	2\
I 	Intensive Cattle grazing 	3\
Small gray 	Pristine Forest	0
token.3=2.3. Every three points produce a material goods card, chosen at will by the participant.
token.4=2.4. The first to accumulate 24 points (eight material goods cards) wins. A round should be completed before \
deciding a winner. If two participants tie on the same round, the goal is increased one point at a time. (26 is the \
maximum achievable score by any participant).
board.title=3. Setting the board and deciding turns.
board.1=3.1 Assemble the four quadrants that make up the playing board. Place the 48 small gray tokens (each \
representing one hectare of pristine forest) on top of the 48 open circles on the board. Set your F, M, and I tokens \
and material goods cards besides your quadrant. Place the deforestation grid where all participants can access it.
board.2=3.2. Number your quadrants and yourselves as participants one to four. Player one starts the furst round; \
other participants follow in clockwise direction. Player two starts the second round (and so on). This avoids giving \
systematic colonizing advantage to any one participant.
land_use.title=4. Land use decisions: token placement rules
land_use.1=4.1 Each participant sets tokens on his/her  quadrant. A creek site (boundary between quadrants) is owned \
by whoever colonizes it first.
land_use.2=4.2. F and M are set directly in any available site; I is placed by substituting a previously placed M. \
A participant«s F and M tokens can substitute each other, but placing an I is an irreversible move.
land_use.3=4.3 Placing an M or I tokens requires cleared land so the pristine forest token is removed from the board \
and placed in the deforestation grid shared by all participants. Placing an F token does not require clearing so the \
pristine forest token is not removed but placed on top of the F.
land_use.4=4.4  A site with an I token should be considered overgrazed, prone to erosion and bare of trees. Two \
contiguous I tokens (e.g. connected by a creek or by a line) generate nonlinear effects (such as excessive local \
erosion, heat and dryness) that collapse production on these sites and nullify the points these tokens provide; \
thereby this situation is not allowed, whether the contiguous I tokens are owned by the same or different participants.
decisions.title=5. How land use decisions can threaten your game
decisions.subtitle=The following rules are illustrated in the game-board figure provided by the facilitator.
decisions.1=5.1. If there are more than two sites deforested with ÒMÓ or ÒIÓ over a creek, and this situation is not \
reversed, the creek is temporarily dried out. When a creek is thus threatened by a participant, his/her her neighbor \
Ð in the next opportunity Ð must reverse one of his/her M tokens on the creek to an F (and lose one point) or refuse \
to and let the creek dry. The participant who threatened the creek cannot reverse the situation himself/herself.  If \
the creek has dried, those involved pick up their M and I token(s), and lose the corresponding points and rights over \
these sites. To use these sites again, they must first wait a turn and re-colonize with an F token.
decisions.2=5.2. If a participant has both creeks threatened, and neither of his neighbors reforest at least one creek \
on the following turn, that participant«s cattle has no access to water. Thus, the participant picks up from the board \
ALL his ÒIÓ and ÒMÓ tokens (and loses the corresponding points).
decisions.3=5.3 SIERRA SPRING assumes that the balance between positive and negative hydrological effects of tree \
cover in this watershed is such that more than thirty two total deforestations dry the spring and creeks during the \
dry season. A neighbor that sets the thirty-third pristine forest token outside the deforestation grid threatens the \
livelihoods of all participants. If no one picks up that token by replacing an M with an F on the same round, all \
participants and cattle must leave the land due to lack of water. The game ends with no winner.
decisions.4=5.4. More than two M or I tokens on the four sites immediately surrounding the spring spoil the water \
during the dry season. A neighbor that sets a third M or I around the spring threatens it. If no one replaces and M \
with an F on the same round, all participants (with their cattle) must leave the territory due to lack of water. The \
game ends with no winner.
decisions.5=5.5 The moment a threat is placed on a creek, on the spring or on the deforestation threshold, the \
participant that creates the threat must announce it to all participants.
