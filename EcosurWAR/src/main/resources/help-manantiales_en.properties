title=SIERRA SPRINGS. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAYERS
title.1=The game has three modalities :  Competitive, Cooperative, and Innovation. We will explain the first one, and at the end introduce modifications required for the other two.
comp.title=COMPETITIVE COORDINATION MODE:
comp.1=1. Purpose and overview of the game
comp.1.a=Learn how to interact with other players in a watershed where land use decisions can have negative consequences for participants. Negotiate land use  with other players to attain a livelihood while avoiding socially and environmentally threatened situations.
comp.1.b=Four players (representing small farmers) take turns to develop forested sites in a wooded watershed. The latter is divided into 4 territories separated by 4 creeks which converge in a spring at the center of the board. Each player colonizes one territory with three land uses that have different values (points). Eight of the sixteen sites on your territory are exclusive for your use, but the other eight are on the borders of other players' properties. The 8 boundary sites you share with your two neighbors will be owned by the first to colonize them. In a round, individual land use decisions are made by each player. The first to accumulate 24 points wins the game.
comp.1.c=The aggregate effect of some land use decisions can degrade the land to the point where some players lose points or even collapse the game before anyone wins it. Players have a limited opportunity to prevent these threats, at a cost for the player who decides to do so.  Thus, players compete to win, but must coordinate their actions to a certain extent if they want to avoid ending the game with no winner.
comp.2=2. Token values and winning conditions
comp.2.a=Each player colonizes his quadrant with three types of land use tokens, one site and token per turn.
comp.2.b=Available land uses, represented by tokens, have the following values:
comp.2.table.row.1=F        PRISTINE FOREST         1
comp.2.table.row.2=M        MODERATE GRAZING        2
comp.2.table.row.3=I        INTENSIVE GRAZING       3
comp.2.c=2.3 Every three points produce a material goods card, chosen at will by the player.
comp.2.d=2.4. The first to accumulate 24 points (eight material goods cards) wins. A round should be completed before deciding a winner. If two players tie on the same round, the goal is increased one point at a time. (26 is the maximum achievable score by any player).
comp.3=3. Setting the board and deciding turns.
comp.3.a=3.1 Place the 48 small green tokens (each representing one hectare of pristine forest) on top of the 48 open circles on the board. Set your F, M, and I tokens and material goods cards besides your quadrant. Place the deforestation grid where all players can access it.
comp.3.b=3.2. Number yourselves as players one to four. Player one starts the first round; other players follow in clockwise direction. Player two starts the second round; player three the third (and so on). This avoids giving systematic advantage to any one player.
comp.4=4. Land use decisions: token placement rules
comp.4.a=4.1 Each player sets tokens on his/her quadrant. A creek site (boundary between quadrants) is owned by whoever colonizes it first.
comp.4.b=4.2. F and M are set directly in any available site; I is placed by substituting a previously placed M.  A player's F and M tokens can substitute each other, but placing an I is an irreversible move.
comp.4.c=4.3 Placing an M or I tokens requires cleared land so the pristine forest token is removed from the board and placed in the deforestation grid shared by all players. Placing an F token does not require clearing so the pristine forest token is not removed but placed on top of the F token.
comp.4.d=4.4 A site with an I token should be considered overgrazed, prone to erosion and bare of trees. Two contiguous I tokens (e.g. connected by a creek or by a line) generate excessive local erosion, heat and dryness that collapse production on these sites and nullify the points these tokens provide; thereby this situation is not allowed, whether the contiguous I tokens are owned by the same or different players.
comp.5=5. How land use decisions can threaten your game
comp.5.sub=Players depend on drinking water from the spring and cattle on water from the creeks. The following conditions threaten the availability of water. They are exemplified in the game-board shown in figure 1.
comp.5.a=5.1. If there are more than two sites deforested with M or I tokens over a creek, and this situation is not reversed, the creek is temporarily dried out. When a creek is thus threatened by a player, his/her neighbor in the -- next opportunity -- must reverse one of his/her M tokens on the creek to an F (and lose one point) or refuse to and let the creek dry. The player who threatened the creek cannot reverse the situation himself/herself.  If the creek has dried, those involved pick up their M and I token(s) on the creek sites, and lose the corresponding points and rights over these sites. To use these sites again, they must first wait a turn and re-colonize with an F token.
comp.5.b=5.2. If a player has both creeks threatened, and neither of his neighbors reforest at least one creek on the following turn, that player's cattle has no access to water. Thus, the player picks up from the board ALL his "I" and "M" tokens (and loses the corresponding points).
comp.5.c=5.3 SIERRA SPRING assumes that the balance between positive and negative hydrological effects of tree cover in this specific watershed is such that more than thirty two total deforestations dry the spring and creeks during the dry season. A neighbor that sets the thirty-third pristine forest token outside the deforestation grid threatens the livelihoods of all players. If no one picks up that token by replacing an M with an F on the same round, all players and cattle must leave the land due to lack of water. The game ends with no winner.
comp.5.d=5.4. More than two M or I tokens on the four sites immediately surrounding the spring spoil the water during the dry season. A neighbor that sets a third M or I around the spring threatens it. If no one replaces and M with an F on the same round, all players (with their cattle) must leave the territory due to lack of water. The game ends with no winner.
comp.5.e=5.5 The moment a threat is placed on a creek, on the spring or on the deforestation threshold, the player that creates the threat must announce it to all players.
coop.title=COOPERATIVE COORDINATION MODALITY
coop.a=In this modality, there is a pre-established "moral economic" goal: nobody should lose his livelihood and end up destitute; in other words, everyone must reach at least 24 points or all lose the game. This goal must be achieved by all players in no more than 45 minutes. Players don't take turns; each can set F, M and I tokens on his/her quadrant at his own pace. Sites on creeks are still owned by who colonizes them first. Players are allowed to talk and discuss moves. Players can work as a team if they chose to do so, but it is not mandatory. I tokens can now be placed directly, without having to substitute M tokens.  All moves are now reversible, i.e. tokens can be removed or relocated at will by their owner, but contiguous I tokens are not allowed.
coop.b=Threats described in section 5 are also operative in this modality and must now be resolved immediately. All players must stay alert and make sure that threatening land use decisions are not overlooked. In case they are, they must be resolved within the 45 minute playing period.
coop.c=If all players reach 24 points before 45 minutes, any player can win a bonus (decided previously by all players) for each additional point he/she can achieve on his/her quadrant within the time limit.
coop.silvo=COMPETITIVE MODALITY WITH LAND USE INNOVATION
coop.silvo.a=In this modality, the cost of life has increased significantly: each resource card now costs 4 points, so now the first player that makes thirty two points wins the game. To achieve this higher score, a more productive land use is introduced, but at a cost: \
once a player has placed an M token, he can decide to upgrade this land use with an I token as before, or he can  choose to innovate  with  a silvopastoral use (S)  which will give him/her 4 points. But before doing so, he/she must exclude the cattle from the site during at least one turn to transplant fodder tree saplings. Thus, the M token must first be substituted in one round by an exclusion (E) token - with a value of zero points - and after at least another round by an S token.  Rules and threats described in sections 4 and 5 are also operative in this modality.
coop.silvo.b=WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW MODALITIES OF THE GAME, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE OTHER SOCIAL ACTORS.
enjoy=ENJOY THE GAMES!
