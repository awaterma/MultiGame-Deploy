gente=GENTE / PEOPLE
gente.description=Gente is a fairly simple board game, adapted from "PENTE" and played on a go-type board.  We \
developed this game to try and explore what "self-centered" versus "selfless" behaviors were; in the context of a four \
player, team based, game.  What we found ourselves actually exploring, is the allure of team-based versus \
individual-based strategies to win.  Players compete as a team and against each other by striving to create \
2 sets of three aligned tokens of the same color (individual competition) or 3 sets of four aligned tokens \
which mix team colors.
manantiales=MANANTIALES DE LA SIERRA / SIERRA SPRINGS
manantiales.description.1=Sierra springs is a more complicated game than Gente, and is the amalgamation of several \
earlier model games and discussions begun at ECOSUR during the ARIDNet international workshop in July of 2008. Sierra \
springs is a multi-level, multi-actor RPG. In its simplest competitive mode, each of four players strives to make a \
livelihood (24 points) by taking turns to colonize their own quadrant of a forested watershed, with \
different types of land-use-tokens having different values. Attaining the goal is non-trivial, as there \
are unwanted neighbour effects, and global deforestation impacts on all players  such that individual \
decisions and scores become interdependent. Higher levels of the game introduce the possibility of \
cooperation and/or innovative, more sustainable land uses.
manantiales.description.2=Although Gente has been played with stakeholders across the spectrum, the abstraction of the \
game has made it difficult for stakeholders to help us completely extend and adapt the game from our initial design. \
However, with Sierra springs, we have had very active stakeholder participation and co-development starting \
with the AridNET academic/peasant stakeholder workshop and through many sessions and workshops in the field, \
government offices and in the academic environment.
manantiales.description.3=Work on interactive game rules progresses to try and address the challenge of dynamic \
stakeholder participation.
methodology=METHODOLOGY
methodology.description=As we mention above, our games have been developed following the COMMOD process, first \
articulated by F. Bousquet and Guy Trebuil (et. al.) in the seminal paper, "An environmental modeling approach: the \
use of multi-agent simulations."</a>  We have focused our work on iterative game designs with a structure faithful to \
environmental models while using Game Theory to qualify outcomes and AI participation.  In the case of Manantiales, \
modeling works to express a stylized simulation of what is actually occurring through development in the Tablon \
watershed/Sepultura buffer zone.
architecture=ARCHITECTURE
architecture.description.1=The diagram that follows is a simplified view of our JEE rules based architecture for games. \
We use a distributed architecture, allowing our server software to cluster, and thereby scale to any size.  Our \
"backend" server implementation is client agnostic; all calls are processed through the scalable EJB middle \
tier.  Our current iteration uses a Flash based gaming client; but clients could be developed and written in \
a variety of technologies that allow for RPC, SOAP or REST based messaging to signal our backend implementation. \
We are currently thinking about implementations for smaller handheld devices (Android, XHTML, WML) as well \
as Apple iPad/iPhone devices.
collab=We are very interested in collaborating with software developers who have an interest in our project.
architecture.description.2=As I mention above, the diagram only roughly sketches some of the structure of our backend \
implementation. A common model, described by a set of interfaces and serializable container classes \
(the Bridge Pattern) interact with a set of common EJBs capable of being externalized via REST or SOAP protocols.  We \
use the Drools rules engine to govern interactions in the game as well as the AI implementation (a fully runnable \
multi-agent system when considered from a COMMOD perspective).  Agents act through rules triggered by \
modifications to the underlying set of entity beans which act as an implementation of the common model on a \
per game basis. Agents and the game itself communicate change by means of a JMS Topic queue; which notifies \
Agent implementations attached to the JMS message bus by means of MessageDrivenBeans and BLAZEDS signaling \
to the Flash user interface.
code.staged=The code staged on our <a href="http://chiapasgames.org:8080/multi-game">JBoss server</a> comes from \
a public repository hosted on GitHub.  Interested software developers (and computer scientists) can view \
our source code under the organization "ECOSUR SISTEMAS COMPLEJOS":
code.private=Note:  new games are kept private until we have been able to publish our work in a peer reviewed \
journal.
