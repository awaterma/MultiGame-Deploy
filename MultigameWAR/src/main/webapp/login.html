                <p> On this server, we have placed computer games developed through our ongoing research in the Tablon watershed
                    in the La Sepultura Reserve of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, a UNESCO world heritage site. Our current
                    computer games implement board games participatively created by researchers and stakeholders in that
                    location. These games have been adapted and/or extended for online play. Our research and development

                        COMMOD</a> process, with our results being based primarily on the gaming aspects of participatory modeling
                    but also making use of multi-agent modeling for experimentation and artificial intelligence.We are members
                    of the COMMOD network and the sustainability aspects of our work are embedded in the inter-institutional

                <h3>GAMES</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, we host two games, GENTE (PEOPLE) and SIERRA SPRINGS (MANANTIALES), with our rules engine based
                    platform.

                </p>
                <p> Gente is a fairly simple board game, adapted from "PENTE" and played on a go-type board.  We developed
                    this game to try and explore what "self-centered" versus "selfless" behaviors were; in the context of a four
                    player, team based, game.  What we found ourselves actually exploring, is the allure of team-based versus
                    individual-based strategies to win.  Players compete as a team and against each other by striving to create
                    2 sets of three aligned tokens of the same color (individual competition) or 3 sets of four aligned tokens
                    which mix team colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sierra springs is a more complicated game than Gente, and is the amalgamation of several earlier model games
                    and discussions begun at ECOSUR during the ARIDNet international workshop in July of 2008. Sierra springs is
                    a multi-level, multi-actor RPG. In its simplest competitive mode, each of four players strives to make a
                    livelihood (24 points) by taking turns to colonize their own quadrant of a forested watershed, with
                    different types of land-use-tokens having different values. Attaining the goal is non-trivial, as there
                    are unwanted neighbour effects, and global deforestation impacts on all players  such that individual
                    decisions and scores become interdependent. Higher levels of the game introduce the possibility of
                    cooperation and/or innovative, more sustainable land uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Gente has been played with stakeholders across the spectrum, the abstraction of the game has made
                    it difficult for stakeholders to help us completely extend and adapt the game from our initial design.
                    However, with Sierra springs, we have had very active stakeholder participation and co-development starting
                    with the AridNET academic/peasant stakeholder workshop and through many sessions and workshops in the field,
                    government offices and in the academic environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work on interactive game rules progresses to try and address the challenge of dynamic stakeholder
                    participation.
                </p>

                <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
                <p>
                    As we mention above, our games have been developed following the COMMOD process, first articulated by F.
                    Bousquet and Guy Trebuil (et. al.) in the seminal paper, <a href="http://cormas.cirad.fr/pdf/adveem.pdf">
                        "An environmental modeling approach: the use of multi-agent simulations."</a>  We have focused our work on
                    iterative game designs with a structure faithful to environmental models while using Game Theory to qualify
                    outcomes and AI participation.  In the case of Manantiales, modeling works to express a stylized simulation
                    of what is actually occurring through development in the Tablon watershed/Sepultura buffer zone.
                </p>

                <div class="separator"></div>
                <h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>
                <p>
                    The diagram that follows is a simplified view of our JEE rules based architecture for games.  We use a
                    distributed architecture, allowing our server software to cluster, and thereby scale to any size.  Our
                    "backend" server implementation is client agnostic; all calls are processed through the scalable EJB middle
                    tier.  Our current iteration uses a Flash based gaming client; but clients could be developed and written in
                    a variety of technologies that allow for RPC, SOAP or REST based messaging to signal our backend implementation.
                    We are currently thinking about implementations for smaller handheld devices (Android, XHTML, WML) as well
                    as Apple iPad/iPhone devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very interested in collaborating with software developers who have an interest in our project.
                </p>
                <div class="centered"><img src="img/architecture.png" alt="MultiGame Architecture Diagram"/></div>
                <p>
                    As I mention above, the diagram only roughly sketches some of the structure of our backend implementation.
                    A common model, described by a set of interfaces and serializable container classes (the Bridge Pattern)
                    interact with a set of common EJBs capable of being externalized via REST or SOAP protocols.  We use the
                    Drools rules engine to govern interactions in the game as well as the AI implementation (a fully runnable
                    multi-agent system when considered from a COMMOD perspective).  Agents act through rules triggered by
                    modifications to the underlying set of entity beans which act as an implementation of the common model on a
                    per game basis. Agents and the game itself communicate change by means of a JMS Topic queue; which notifies
                    Agent implementations attached to the JMS message bus by means of MessageDrivenBeans and BLAZEDS signaling
                    to the Flash user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code staged on <a href="http://chiapasgames.net">chiapasgames.net</a> comes from a private repository
                    which will soon be made public.  Interested software developers (and computer scientists) can view the
                    common and public version of our source code (including all common libraries, EJBs and the implementation of
                    the game of Gente and its agents) on the following URL at GitHub:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Our private repository is driven out of concurrent work being done in the development branch of the
                    public repository.
